This code for the most part is very simple and self explanatory. I take the Math function from the header file and implement it in the c file. The functionality of the math function is by using a switch statement to decipher which math operation it will perform. In main it will prompt the user to enter two numbers to be used as well as a Letter which chooses which operation will be used in the switch statement. This code can easily be used and modified as well as being understood by people of all skill levels in programming.

First Modification:
I took all the code I wrote in an online compiler and pasted it into the github file.

Second Modification: 
I added comments to my work as well as I added a default part to the switch statement which I forgot to add previously.
